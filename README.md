# MD2_Report
This is a command line tool that dumps the header data for Quake2 MD2 model files.
Open the .sln and build. Copy the executable to a suitable location or to a folder
on your system path.
Two sample files are included: tris.md2 is a valid MD2 model and trisout.md2 is a
conversion of a valid MD3 to a MD2 with invalid header data.
